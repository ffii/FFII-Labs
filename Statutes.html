<h1 id="A.2BAKc-1_Name_and_location_of_the_association">§1 Name and location of the association</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><p class="line874">(1) The association is named "Förderverein für eine freie informationelle Infrastruktur" (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure). <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line874">(2) Upon registration in the register the name becomes Förderverein für eine freie informationelle Infrastruktur e.V. <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><p class="line874">(3) The association is registered in Munich. <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line874">(4) The fiscal year of the association is the calendar year. The first financial year begins on the date of incorporation and ends on December 31 of the same calendar year. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line874">(5) The association exclusively and directly pursues public-benefit purposes within the meaning of the "tax-privileged purposes" of the tax code. <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-2_Purpose_of_the_association:_making_information_infrastructures_accessible">§2 Purpose of the association: making information infrastructures accessible</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line874">(1) The purpose of the association is public education, consumer protection and promotion of democracy. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line874">(2) The association's purpose is pursued in particular by making available free of charge, creating, and legally protecting public information goods, i.e. information goods to which the following criteria apply as well as possible: <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867"><strong>I. Free availability</strong>: Everyone can use the information (e.g. develop, use, and redistribute it at least as long as the public-benefit conditions listed here are respected), without the need of consent of any owner (e.g. owner of any author, copyright, patent, exploitation or other rights). <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867"><strong>II: Openness of Source</strong>: The information is available in source form (the primary form), i.e., in that form in which its author has designed it and would continue to develop it himself. Everyone has the opportunity to seize the initiative to develop the information work himself. This approach is not hampered by unnecessary obstacles. No non-free tools are required to continue development. <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line867"><strong>III: Open Interfaces</strong>: The information can be used and developed independently of other information goods, especially independently from software products that do not satisfy both above criteria. All "system requirements" of the information good are publicly specified, i.e. not in the form of manufacturers' or product names but in form of references to freely available descriptions of freely implementable interfaces. These interfaces allow automatized access for the main functionality available to the outside, are built up systematically and do not contain unneeded complexity, are fixed by definitive documentation and independent from the further development of the information good.  <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><p class="line867"><strong>IV Educational value</strong>: The information opens access to knowledge and methods hitherto closed. It is suited to increase the ability of their users. It does not contain any anti-enlightenment elements (e.g. product advertisement, pornography and hate propaganda). <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-3_Desired_effects:_education.2C_compatibility.2C_protection_of_environment.2C_cultivation_of_culture">§3 Desired effects: education, compatibility, protection of environment, cultivation of culture</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><p class="line874">The dissemination of public benefit information goods in sense of the association's purpose has some desirable societal effects, by which the association will be guided when choosing the focus of its work:  <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><p class="line867"><strong>I. Enlightenment</strong>: Motivation for understanding use of data processing systems, enabling to cope with unexpected problems, guidance to set oneself free of self-encumbered informational immaturity. Unrestricted access to the world cultural heritage, to lexica, handbooks and teaching materials, unrestricted integration of these works in all kinds of data processing materials. Experiencing the joy of creating and sharing information instead of hoarding information. Cultivation of hacker ethics as aptly described by E.S. Raymond.  <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><p class="line867"><strong>II. Compatibility, free access to key technologies</strong>: Public information prevents market monopolies. When two systems do not match together, all competitors have the access to information that is necessary to help themselves and enable exchange. <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><p class="line867"><strong>III. Fostering local language and culture</strong>: Free information keeps informational competence at home. We ensure that important information is available for the people of our country persons in their own language.  <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-4_Means:_Educational_events.2C_public_tenders.2C_buying_free.2C_patenting_free">§4 Means: Educational events, public tenders, buying free, patenting free</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><p class="line874">(1) The purposes of the statute are achieved in particular through the following activities: <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><ul><li>Organisation of talks, lectures, seminars and other public education events. <span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span></li><li>Generation of public information by public tender of works or buying (and liberating) existing information works. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span></li><li>Measures to protect free information against attacks by software patents. For this benefit the association may for example "patent free" technology invented by members or friends, that is it can patent these technologies and irrevocably guarantee their usability in free information works.  <span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">(2) The association only takes roles that for-profit companies cannot take according to their purpose. It popularizes, generates and protects information for the public benefit, but does not compete with distributors or internet access providers.  <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-5_Sources_and_Use_of_Funds">§5 Sources and Use of Funds</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><p class="line874">(1) The association acts selflessly; it does not pursue goals primarily serving its own economic interest. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><p class="line874">(2) The association is funded by membership contributions and donations. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><p class="line874">(3) The association's funds may only be used for statutory purposes. Members do not receive payments from the association's funds. <span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><p class="line874">(4) The services provided by the association address the entire public. Association members do not have privileged access. Whenever services are offered for a fee, members do not receive a discount. <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><p class="line874">(5) No person may be advantaged by payments alien to the purpose of the association or be benefiting from inadequately high remuneration. <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><p class="line874">(6) All income and expenditure of the association are publicly documented and are justified publicly and in written form in view of the  statutory purposes and criteria to be determined by the General Assmbly. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-6_Membership">§6 Membership</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><p class="line874">(1) The association has contributing and active members. <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><p class="line874">(2) Active members have the active and passive election right in the general assembly.

But the rights of an active member can only be excercised by a natural person. Organisations may become active members only by endowing a natural person with their active representation for a continuous period of at least two years. <span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line874">(4) The founders are members of the association. The board decides on new membership after written application. The decision is communicated to the applicant and all members. New members are contributing members at least until the general assembly. <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><p class="line874">(5) A member is granted active status by the general assembly. An active member becomes a contributing member if the member so wishes.  <span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-7_Contributions.2C_Loss_of_Membership">§7 Contributions, Loss of Membership</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line874">(1) The association charges an annual membership fee. Its amount is determined by the general assembly. <span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><p class="line874">(2) In case a member is at least two contributions in arrears, it can be excluded by the board. <span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><p class="line874">(3) All voluntary contributions are owned finally and unconditionally by the association from the moment they are paid. <span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><p class="line874">(4) Every member can immediately leave the association by telling its intention to the board. <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line874">(5) The general assembly shall review and decide on the status of all members in one block at the beginning of each general assembly. The newly decided rights take effect after the whole block has been completed. Before that, the previously decided rights remain in force. Decisions to exclude or degrade members against their will can only be taken on the basis of a written proposal, which must explain in which way these members are failing to fulfill their obligations, and which must conform to this statute's general provisions about submission of proposals to the general assembly.  <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-8_Organs_of_the_Association">§8 Organs of the Association</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line874">The institutions of the association are the general assembly and the board. The members of the board are not salaried.  <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="A.2BAKc-9_General_Assembly">§9 General Assembly</h1>
